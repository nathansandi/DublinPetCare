			<h2>Testimonials</h2>
			<h3>Josep Oliveira</h3>
			<p>I would like to thank all of the staff at the Dublin PetCare, My dog Butch has had many health problems and we have always received excellent service, a friendly reception and brilliant aftercare.  Recently he was sick and when examined had a lump in his stomach. Surgery was performed and fortunately it was a hematoma in his spleen, the spleen was removed and he is now back to his old self. I feel that the staff really care about Butch and all the other animals they treat, they are all well trained, friendly and polite. The practice is kept very clean and tidy. </p>
			<h3>Marilia Sanos</h3>
			<p align="center"><img src="images/dog1.jpg" width="242" height="161" alt="" /></p>
			<p>Jones Vets have been our choice of veterinary clinic since they first opened and we as a family had our first pet. The treatment of each of them received over the years was and is second to none. Our Mini Yorkshire Terrier, Penny, sadly died last year aged 16. The care and attention given to her and us at that time was much appreciated. Lara, our White German Shepherd is and has been a regular visitor at the surgery for the past few years, since becoming blind and now having issues with her hips. Lara trusts Gill implicitly and makes her visits to the surgery a comfortable one. The staff are always friendly and polite, making a trip to the surgery a less distressing/traumatic experience for any pet and their owner. We would highly recommend them to anyone</p>
